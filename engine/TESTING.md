We use Jest framework for testing code.  

In order to run tests type `npm run test` in package's root directory.  
Settings for testing can be found in `jest.config.js` file.

`npm run test -- --watch` runs Jest in watch mode. In this mode Jest performs all tests every time a file in project has been modified.
